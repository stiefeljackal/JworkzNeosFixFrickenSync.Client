# Neos Fix Fricken Sync - User Client Visualization (JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.Client)

![An animation showing the new sync screen.](docs/sync_progress_animated.gif)

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that adds a new Sync screen on your Dash. With this new screen, it will allow one to:

* See the current sync tasks that occur when you save or update items such as inventory objects, worlds, audio messages, folders, and shared folders.
* Force sync or discard unsync conflicting items in VR instead of adding the flag to your client.
* Keep the conflicting item as a copied item while retaining the original.
* Review your sync history with the option to clear the activity.

This is an **add-in** mod of the [JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync](https://github.com/stiefeljackal/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync) mod to help visualize your sync tasks. Because of this, you will need to make sure that JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync (2.0.0 or greater) is also included in your mod folder. For a demonstration, you may checkout the following video:

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.dll](https://github.com/stiefeljackal/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync/releases/latest/download/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. The version of this mod should be 2.0.0 or greater.
3. Place [JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.Client.dll](https://github.com/stiefeljackal/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.Client/releases/latest/download/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.Client.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be located in the same folder as Neos. For a default installation, the typical location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods`. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working, you can check your Neos logs.
